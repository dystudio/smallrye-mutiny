The previous examples illustrated how to transform each item from a stream into another item. 
Yet, there are cases where we need to go beyond this, for example:

* Transforming an item into a `Uni` - any asynchronous processing such as calling a remote service, interacting with a database, etc
* Transforming an item into a `Multi` - producing a multi-items stream based on the incoming item, filtering out items, etc

Having the possibility to transform an item into a stream gives us many opportunities. 
To implement such transformations, we use `onItem().transformToUni(Funcction<T, Uni<O>>` and `onItem().transformToMulti(Function<T, Multi<O>>)`

== Uni - Transforming an item into a Uni

Imagine you have a `Uni<String>`, and you want to call a remote service.

Calling a remote service is an asynchronous action represented by a `Uni`, as in:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=service]
----

To call this service, you need to transform the item received from the first `Uni` into the `Uni` returned by the service:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=call]
----

This snippet _chains_ the first `Uni` with another one. 
The returned `Uni` (`result`) emits the result from the remote service or a failure if anything wrong happened:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=chain]
----

== Uni - Transforming an item into a Multi

The previous example produced a single item.
You may want to transform the received item into a stream which is... a `Multi`!

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=uni-to-multi]
----

This code creates a stream of two elements, duplicating the received item.

----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=uni-to-multi-2]
----

The produced `Multi` objects can of course be more complicated that that and emit items in an asynchronous fashion.

== Transforming items from Multi - the _merge_ vs _concatenate_ dilemma

When transforming items emitted by an upstream `Multi,` we need to answer the following question: how are we going to _merge_ the produced items back?

Let's take an example.
Imagine a `Multi` emitting the `Cameron` and `Donna` items (in order), and you want to call the `invokeRemoteGreetingService` from above.
It thus calls `invokeRemoteGreetingService("Cameron")` then `invokeRemoteGreetingService("Donna")`.

The service does not have a constant response time (because of network latency or the load), which means that responses can be interleaved. 
Indeed, you may receive `"Hello Donna"` before `"Hello Cameron"`.

Now, how do you want to handle this case?
Do you need to preserve the order and ensure that the downstream subscriber will always get `"Hello Cameron"` first, or do you accept interleaved responses?

When transforming items from `Multi` into streams, you need to decide in which order the items emitted by the produced stream are going to be received by the downstream subscriber.
Mutiny offers two possibilities:

* _merge_ - it does not preserve the order and emits the items from the produced streams as they come,
* _concatenate_ - it maintains and concatenates the streams produced for each item.

== Multi - Transforming an item into a Uni

To implement the scenario from the last section, you will use `onItem().transformToUniAndMerge` or `onItem().transformToUniAndConcatenate()` depending on your ordering choice:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsAsyncTest.java[tag=merge-concat]
----

== Multi - Transforming an item into a Multi

`onItem().transformToMultiAndMerge` and `onItem().transformToMultiAndConcatenate` transform incoming items into `Multi` streams.
The produced `Multi` objects are either _merged_ or _concatenated_:
