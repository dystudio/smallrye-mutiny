Both `Unis` and `Multis` emit _items_.
One of the most common operations you will do is transforming these items using a synchronous 1-to-1 function.

To achieve this, you use `onItem().transform(Function<T, U>)`.
It calls the passed function for each item and produces the result as an item which is propagaed downstream.

== Transforming items produced by a Uni

Let's imagine you have a `Uni<String>,` and you want to capitalize the received `String`.
Implementing this transformation is done as follows:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsTest.java[tag=uni-transform]
----

== Transforming items produced by a Multi

The only difference for `Multi` is that the function is called for each item:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsTest.java[tag=multi-transform]
----

The produced items are passed to the downstream subscriber:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsTest.java[tag=multi-transform-2]
----

== What if the transformation failed?

If the transformation throws an exception, that exception is caught and passed to the downstream subscriber as a _failure_ event.
It also means that the subscriber won't get further item after that failure.

== Chaining multiple transformations

You can chain multiple transformations:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TransformItemsTest.java[tag=chain]
