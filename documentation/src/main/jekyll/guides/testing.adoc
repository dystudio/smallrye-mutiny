== How can I write unit / integration tests?

Mutiny provides subscribers for `Uni` and `Multi` offering helpful assertion methods.
You can use them to test pipelines.

Here is an example to test a `Uni`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/TestSubscribersTest.java[tags=uni]
----

Testing a `Multi` pipeline is similar:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}//TestSubscribersTest.java[tags=multi]
----

The assertions do not just focus on _good_ outcomes, you can also test failures as in:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}//TestSubscribersTest.java[tags=failing]
----
