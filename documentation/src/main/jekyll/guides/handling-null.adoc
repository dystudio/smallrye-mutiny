The `Uni` type can emit `null` as item.
While there are mixed feelings about `null`, it's part of the Java language and so handled in the `Uni` type.
`Multi` does not support `null` items as it would break the compatibility with Reactive Streams.

Emitting `null` is convenient when returning `Uni<Void>`.
However, the downstream must expect `null` as item.

Thus, `Uni` provides specific methods to handle `null` item.
`uni.onItem().ifNull()` lets you decide what you want to do when the received item is `null`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/UniNullTest.java[tags=code]
----

A symmetric group of methods is also available with `ifNotNull` which let you handle the case where the item is _not null_:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/UniNullTest.java[tags=code-not-null]
----

IMPORTANT: While supported, emitting `null` should be avoided except for `Uni<Void>`.
