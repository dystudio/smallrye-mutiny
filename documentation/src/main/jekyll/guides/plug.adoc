Yes, but please write operators responsibly!

Both `Uni` and `Multi` support custom operators using the `plug` operator.
Here is an example where we use a custom `Multi` operator that randomly drops items:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/PlugTest.java[tags=plug]
----

with the operator defined as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{include_dir}/PlugTest.java[tags=custom-operator]
----

[WARNING]
====
Custom operators are an advanced feature: when possible please use the existing operators and use helpers such as `stage` to write readable code.
In the case of custom `Multi` operators it is wise to test them against the _Reactive Streams TCK_.
