SmallRye Mutiny is a reactive programming library.
Wait? Another one? Yes!

Mutiny is designed after having experienced many issues with other Reactive programming libraries and having seen many developers lost in an endless sequence of _flatMap_.
Mutiny takes a different approach.
First, Mutiny does not provide as many operators as the other famous libraries, focusing instead on the most used operators.
Furthermore, Mutiny provides a more _guided_ API, which avoids having classes with hundreds of methods that cause trouble for even the smartest IDE.
Finally, Mutiny has built-in converters from and to other reactive programming libraries, so you can always pivot.

Before digging into Mutiny, we need to understand how it relates to the other _reactive thingies_.

Mutiny covers the _yellow_ part of the landscape: it's an event-driven reactive programming library, supporting (Reactive Streams) based back-pressure.
It reuses ideas from http://reactivex.io/[Reactive eXtensions] but does not follow the same API guidelines and operators.
Also, it can be used to build Reactive Systems, for example, by combining, Mutiny, and https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/[Reactive Messaging].
